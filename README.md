Simple, lovely job board.

The data comes from scrapers. 
A lot of flexibility in filtering rules and the filters work.
Search results are updated real-time as scraper runs and you can save interesting items to customized archives.
Search rules and jobs you save are kept in localStorage if you don't want to log in. However, search results do not persist by design.

At this point, it works almost just fine functionality-wise for a single user which is me. But a lot more needs to be done. Also, the source is still limited to Linkedin.
